<a id="obi"></a><h2>Obi-Wan Kenobi</h2>

<p>
In Episode III: Revenge of the Sith,  Obi-Wan Kenobi<br>
 is a member of the Jedi Council and a General in the Army of the Republic.<br>
Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker remains Obi-Wan's partner, and the two have become war heroes and best friends. 
The film opens with the two on a rescue mission to save the kidnapped Supreme Chancellor Palpatine from Separatist commander General Grievous onboard his starship. 
Count Dooku discovers the attempt and fights the Jedi, knocking Obi-Wan unconscious; while Obi-Wan is out cold, Anakin defeats Dooku and executes him on Palpatine's orders. 
Soon after returning to Coruscant, Obi-Wan is called away to the planet Utapau to track down the escaped Grievous.
After finding the Separatist encampment,<em> Obi-Wan fights Grievous and eventually kills the cyborg using his enemy's own blaster. </em><br>
When Palpatine — who is secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, the mastermind of the war — issues <strong><em>Order 66</em></strong> to have the clone troopers turn on the Jedi, Obi-Wan survives the attempt on his life and escapes, 
rendezvousing with Yoda and Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan aboard Organa's ship Tantive IV. Returning to Coruscant, he and Yoda discover that every Jedi in the Jedi Temple has been murdered. 
After sending a beacon to all surviving Jedi to scatter across the galaxy and remain in hiding, a heartbroken Obi-Wan watches security footage revealing that it was Anakin — who is now Sidious' Sith apprentice Darth Vader— who led the slaughter. 
Yoda says he will confront Sidious, and charges Obi-Wan with fighting Vader. Obi-Wan is loath to fight his best friend, but reluctantly accepts.<br>

Obi-Wan visits Padmé to learn of Vader's whereabouts, and realizes that Vader is her husband and the father of her unborn child. 
When Padmé sets out to the volcanic planet Mustafar to confront her husband herself, Obi-Wan secretly stows away in the ship. 
After they arrive on Mustafar, Obi-Wan reveals himself and confronts Vader, who accuses Padmé and Obi-Wan of conspiring against him and uses the dark side to choke Padmé into unconsciousness. <br>
After a long and ferocious lightsaber duel, Obi-Wan defeats Vader by severing his legs and left arm; as Vader catches fire beside a lava river, Obi-Wan takes his former friend's lightsaber and leaves him to die. 
Unknown to Obi-Wan, Vader is rescued by Palpatine and reconstructed into the cyborg first seen in the original trilogy.<br>

Obi-Wan takes Padmé to a remote asteroid belt, where she dies after giving birth to twins Luke and Leia.
Afterwards, Yoda instructs Obi-Wan to give Luke to his uncle Owen and aunt Beru on Tatooine, and reveals that Qui-Gon's spirit has returned from the Force to continue Obi-Wan's training. 
Obi-Wan hands Luke off to his family and goes into exile on Tatooine. <br>

<h2><a id="ani"></a> Anakin Skywalker / Darth Vader</h2>
<p>
In Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, set three years after Attack of the Clones, Anakin is now a Jedi Knight and a hero of the Clone Wars.
He and Obi-Wan lead a mission to rescue Palpatine from Separatist commander General Grievous on board his starship. 
The two Jedi battle Count Dooku, whom Anakin eventually executes on Palpatine's command. <br>
They rescue Palpatine and return to Coruscant. Anakin reunites with Padmé, who tells him she is pregnant. 
Although initially excited, Anakin has prophetic visions of Padmé dying in childbirth and his worry steadily grows, 
as they are similar to the visions he had of his mother before she died.<br>
 Later, Palpatine reveals to Anakin that he is the Sith Lord, Darth Sidious,
 saying that only he has the knowledge to save Padmé from dying.
 Anakin reports Palpatine's treachery to Jedi Master Mace Windu, who subdues him.
 Desperate to save Padmé, Anakin intervenes on the Palpatine's behalf, allowing him to kill Windu. 
 Anakin pledges himself to the dark side and becomes Palpatine's new Sith apprentice, 
 and his new master bestows upon him the name Darth Vader.<br><br>

Vader then leads a band of clones to murder everyone at the Jedi Temple before he kills 
the remaining Separatist leaders hiding on the volcanic planet Mustafar. 
Padmé travels to Mustafar and implores Vader to abandon the dark side, but he refuses and 
asks her to help overthrow Palpatine so they can rule the galaxy together.<br> 
Upon witnessing Obi-Wan present, Vader furiously chokes Padmé into unconsciousness, 
thinking that she brought Obi-Wan to kill him. Obi-Wan duels and defeats Vader, 
severing his arm and both of his legs, and leaves him at the bank of a lava river, 
where he is horribly burned. Palpatine finds Vader still alive and brings him to Coruscant, 
where his apprentice's mutilated body is treated and covered in the black armored suit first depicted in the original trilogy. 
Palpatine explains to Vader that he himself killed Padmé in his rage, devastating him and leaving him in pain. <br>
At the end of the film, Vader supervises the construction of the first Death Star alongside Palpatine and Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin. <br>

<a id="padme"></a><h2>Padmé Amidala</h2>
<p>
Padmé Amidala makes her third film appearance in Revenge of the Sith, which is set three years later. <br>
After Anakin returns from rescuing Palpatine, she informs him that she is pregnant. Padmé detects changes in Anakin after he begins having dreams about her dying in childbirth. 
Eventually, these fears lead to Anakin turning to the dark side of the Force and becoming Palpatine's Sith apprentice, Darth Vader. 
Meanwhile, Padmé watches with increasing suspicion as Palpatine uses the Clone War in control over the Senate and judiciary. <br>
In another deleted scene, Padmé is seen as a dissenter in Palpatine's government and an early constituting member of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, joined by senators Bail Organa, Mon Mothma and Bana Breemu.


As Palpatine declares martial law by transforming the Republic into the Galactic Empire, Padmé remarks to Organa: "So this is how liberty dies – with thunderous applause". <br>
After Palpatine names himself emperor for life, Obi-Wan informs Padmé that her husband has turned to the dark side and killed everyone in the Jedi Temple. Unable to believe this, Padmé travels to the volcanic planet Mustafar (with Obi-Wan a stowaway aboard her ship). <br><br>
Padmé begs Vader to escape Palpatine's grasp and flee with her, but Vader insists that, together, they can overthrow Palpatine and rule the galaxy. 
Padmé recoils in horror, but still tries to persuade him to abandon the dark side. When Obi-Wan emerges from her ship, Vader accuses Padmé of betrayal and uses the Force to choke her into unconsciousness.

After Obi-Wan defeats Vader in a lightsaber duel, he brings Padmé to the secret asteroid base Polis Massa. 
Despite efforts of medical droids, Padmé inexplicably dies soon after delivering twins, Luke and Leia. 
It is implied that Darth Sidious killed her by siphoning her life force into Vader to help him survive his injuries.<br>
 Just prior to her death, Padmé insists to Obi-Wan that she knows "there is still good" in Anakin. 
 After Padmé's body is altered to appear still pregnant and given an elaborate funeral ceremony on Naboo, her twins are separated to be hidden from Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine: 
 Leia is adopted by Senator Organa and his wife Queen Organa on Alderaan to be raised as a princess, while Luke is brought to Tatooine to be raised by his step-grandfather's family, Owen and Beru Lars.<br>

<a id="palpatine"></a><h2>Palpatine</h2>
<p>
In the 2005 sequel Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, set three years later, Palpatine is captured by cyborg Separatist General Grievous, as part of a plan devised by Sidious.<br>
 Palpatine is rescued by Anakin and Obi-Wan, but not before the Jedi confront Dooku again.
 A duel ensues in which Anakin defeats Dooku. Palpatine urges Anakin to kill the unarmed Dooku; after some hesitance, Anakin kills Dooku in cold blood. 
 Palpatine then escapes with his Jedi rescuers and returns to Coruscant. By this point, Palpatine has become a virtual dictator, able to take any action in the Senate. 
 He makes Anakin his personal representative on the Jedi Council, who deny Anakin the rank of Jedi Master and order him to spy on the Chancellor. <br>
 Palpatine tells Anakin the story of Darth Plagueis, a powerful Sith Lord who was able to manipulate life and death but was killed by his own apprentice. 
 Eventually, Palpatine reveals his secret Sith Lord identity to Anakin; he knows that Anakin has been having prophetic visions of Padmé dying in childbirth, and offers to teach Plageuis' secrets to save Padme's life.<br><br>
 

Anakin informs Jedi Master Mace Windu of Palpatine's treachery.
 With three other Jedi masters at his side, Windu attempts to arrest Palpatine, but Palpatine produces a lightsaber from his sleeve and quickly dispatches all but Windu. <br>
 Palpatine engages Windu in a duel and fires Force lightning at the Jedi Master, but Windu deflects the lightning back at its source, deforming Palpatine's face into the gray, wizened visage seen in the original trilogy. 
 Just as Windu is about to dispatch Palpatine, Anakin appears and intervenes on the Sith Lord's behalf, allowing Palpatine to kill Windu with another blast of lightning, throwing Windu out of a window high above Coruscant. <br>
 Anakin then pledges himself to the dark side as Palpatine's Sith apprentice, Darth Vader.<br><br>

Palpatine issues Order 66, commanding the clone troopers to turn on their Jedi generals, while dispatching Vader to kill everyone inside the Jedi Temple and then murder the Separatist leaders on the planet Mustafar. <br>
Palpatine then reorganizes the Republic into the Galactic Empire, with himself as Emperor. In Palpatine's office, Jedi Master Yoda confronts him and engages the Sith Lord in a lightsaber duel that ends in a stalemate. 
Sensing that Vader is in danger, Palpatine travels to Mustafar and finds his new apprentice near death following a duel with Obi-Wan. <br>
After returning to Coruscant, he rebuilds Vader's burned, mutilated body with the black armored suit from the original trilogy. 
Palpatine then tells Vader that Padmé was killed in the heat of Vader's anger, breaking what remains of his apprentice's spirit. <br>
Palpatine is last seen watching the original Death Star's construction, with Vader and Wilhuff Tarkin at his side. <br>
