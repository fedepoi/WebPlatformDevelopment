<h2>A bit of History</h2>



<p>
Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith <br>is a 2005 American epic space opera film written and directed by George Lucas.<br>
It is the sixth entry in the Star Wars film series and stars<em> <a href="../CharacterPage/CharacterPage.html#ani">Hayden Christensen</a>, 
<a href="../CharacterPage/CharacterPage.html#obi">Ewan McGregor</a>,
 <a href="../CharacterPage/CharacterPage.html#padme">Natalie Portman</a>,
 <a href="../CharacterPage/CharacterPage.html#palpatine">Ian McDiarmid</a>, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, and Frank Oz.</em>
A sequel to The Phantom Menace (1999) and Attack of the Clones (2002), it is the third and final installment in the Star Wars prequel trilogy.<br><br>

The film begins three years after the onset of the Clone Wars. 
The Jedi Knights are spread across the galaxy, leading a massive war against the Separatists.<br> 
The Jedi Council dispatches Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi to eliminate the notorious General Grievous, the leader of the Separatist Army.
Meanwhile, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker grows close to Palpatine, the Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic and, secretly, a Sith Lord known as Darth Sidious.<br> 
Their deepening friendship threatens the Jedi Order, the Republic, and Anakin's best interest.<br><br>

Lucas began writing the script before production of Attack of the Clones ended. <br>
Production of Revenge of the Sith started in September 2003, and filming took place in Australia with additional locations in Thailand, Switzerland, China, Italy and the United Kingdom.
Revenge of the Sith premiered on May 15, 2005, at the Cannes Film Festival, then released worldwide on May 19, 2005. 
The film received generally favorable reviews from critics, especially in contrast to the mixed reviews of the previous two prequels:
praise was directed towards its action sequences, mature themes, musical score, visual effects, and the performances of McGregor, McDiarmid, Oz, and Jimmy Smits; criticism was aimed at the film's screenplay, inconsistent tone, and Christensen's performance.<br>

Revenge of the Sith broke several box office records during its opening week and went on to earn over $848 million worldwide, making it, at the time, the third-highest-grossing film in the Star Wars franchise, unadjusted for inflation.
It was the highest-grossing film in the U.S. in 2005 and the second-highest grossing film worldwide.
<strong>The film also holds the record for the highest opening day gross on a Thursday, making $50 million.</strong> <br>

<h2>The Plot</h2>
<p>
Three years after the beginning of the Clone Wars,<br> Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker lead a mission to rescue the kidnapped Supreme Chancellor Palpatine from the cyborg Separatist commander, General Grievous, during a space battle over Coruscant. After infiltrating Grievous's flagship, the Jedi battle Count Dooku, whom Anakin executes at Palpatine's urging.
Grievous escapes the battle-torn ship in which the Jedi crash-land on Coruscant.<br>
There, Anakin reunites with his wife, Padmé Amidala, who reveals that she is pregnant. 
<strong>While initially excited, Anakin begins to have prophetic visions of Padmé dying in childbirth.</strong><br>

Palpatine appoints Anakin to the Jedi Council as his representative and informant, but the Council declines to grant Anakin the rank of Jedi Master, and orders him to spy on Palpatine, diminishing Anakin's faith in the Jedi.
Palpatine tempts Anakin with his knowledge of the dark side of the Force, including the power to prevent death. 
Meanwhile, Obi-Wan travels to Utapau, where he kills Grievous, and Yoda travels to the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk to defend it from invasion. 
Palpatine reveals to Anakin that he is the Sith Lord Darth Sidious and that he knows how to save Padmé. Anakin reports Palpatine's treachery to Mace Windu, who confronts and subdues the Sith Lord, disfiguring his face.
 However, fearing that he will lose Padmé, Anakin severs Windu's hand, allowing Palpatine to cast him out the window to his death.<br> 
Anakin pledges himself to Sidious, who dubs him Darth Vader.<strong> As the Supreme Chancellor, Palpatine issues an order that causes the clone troopers to betray and kill their commanding Jedi officers.</strong> 
Vader kills the remaining Jedi in the temple including the child younglings, then travels to the volcanic planet of Mustafar to slaughter the Separatist leaders. 
Palpatine declares himself Emperor before the Galactic Senate, transforming the Republic into the Galactic Empire. 
Having survived the chaos, Obi-Wan and Yoda return to Coruscant and learn of Vader's betrayal.<br>

Padmé goes to Mustafar and implores Vader to return to the light side. Vader sees Obi-Wan on Padmé's ship, and thinking they have conspired to kill him, angrily chokes Padmé. 
Obi-Wan engages Vader in a lightsaber duel, and after gaining the higher ground, warns his former pupil to stand down. When Vader attacks, Obi-Wan severs his legs and arm, leaving him at the bank of a lava flow, severely burned. 
On Coruscant, Yoda battles Palpatine until their duel reaches a stalemate. Yoda then flees with Bail Organa while Palpatine, sensing that his apprentice is in danger, travels to Mustafar.<br>

Obi-Wan regroups with Yoda on the asteroid Polis Massa, where Padmé gives birth to a boy and girl, whom she names Luke and Leia, respectively, before dying. 
On Mustafar, Palpatine finds Vader still alive and brings him to Coruscant, where his mutilated body is treated and covered in a black armored suit. 
Meanwhile, Obi-Wan and Yoda conceal the twins from the Sith. Yoda exiles himself to the planet Dagobah, while Vader and the Emperor oversee the construction of the Death Star. 
Bail Organa adopts Leia and takes her to Alderaan, while Obi-Wan delivers Luke to his step-family, Owen and Beru Lars, on Tatooine.<br> <br>
